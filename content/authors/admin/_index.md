bio: |
    I am an assistant professor in
    the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division
    at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/) and a member of
    the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/). My research interests lie at the interface of
    machine learning and decision-making. I develop robust and reliable
    methods for data-driven decision making, extending and connecting
    tools across ML, operations research, and causal inference. Outside
    of academia, I serve as a LinkedIn Scholar at LinkedIn's Trust and
    Responsible AI team.

    I received my Ph.D. from [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu) in 2019 and spent a year
    at [Facebook Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/core-data-science/) as a research scientist. Here's a more
    formal [bio](./bio.html) in the third person.'
